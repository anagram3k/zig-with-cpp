# `Zig` with `C++`

This is a simple example to demonstrate Zig interfacing with C++ code. 

The only requirement is a C interface.

The c++ code is based on  [C Wrappers for C++ Libraries and Interoperability](https://caiorss.github.io/C-Cpp-Notes/CwrapperToQtLibrary.html)

# Run
Use below script to run.
```bash
zig build run
```

# Test
